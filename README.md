This was my Database Management Course Project. It is inspired by the co-win portal used by the Goverment of India for the covid vaccination. It has three seperate Login Options : Admin( Government Officials ) , Vaccination Centers and the Citizens. 

* Users can easily manage their bookings and track their vaccine schedule.
* The users can filter centers according to the vaccine and pincode preference.
* Download Certificate option is also made available to the users. 
* The user can raise a complaint, if he/she faces any issue post vaccination.
* The Vaccination centers can manage bookings in real time. Once the user has been vaccinated the center approves the same and the record is updated.
* The vaccination Center can order vaccines from the suppkier if it falls short of jabs.
* The admin is responsible for addition/deletion of vaccination centers if required and gets real time data of all the vaccination centers.
